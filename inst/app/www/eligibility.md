###### Who can apply

Anyone can apply as long as they do not have savings or investments over a certain limit. You cannot get help if you or your partner (or both) have more than: 

* £16,000 in savings, investments or property (not including the place where you live) 
* £23,250 in savings, investments or property if you live permanently in a care home (£24,000 if you live in Wales)

###### Who does not need to apply

You do not need to apply if you're already entitled to full help with health costs.

You already get full help with health costs if you or your partner get:

* Income Support
* income-based Jobseeker's Allowance
* income-related Employment and Support Allowance
* Pension Credit Guarantee Credit
* Universal Credit - if your earnings during your last complete assessment period were £435 or less, or £935 or less if you had a child element or had limited capability for work

You’re also entitled to full help if you are named on, or entitled to, an [NHS tax credit exemption certificate](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/exemption-certificates/nhs-tax-credit-exemption-certificates).

Any dependent children under 20 included on your benefit or tax credit claim are also entitled to the same help.
