#### Final thoughts

Although the NHS Low Income Scheme provides great support to its recipients, the application rates have been steadily declining. 

Additionally, partial benefit certificates only provide help to limited numbers of people for more preventative treatments.

Driving up **awareness** whilst making the **application process** smoother could help ensure that the support available is provided to those in need. And this will become increasingly important, should the upper prescription age for prescription exemption increase.
