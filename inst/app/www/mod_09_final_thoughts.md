## Final thoughts

Although the NHS Low Income Scheme provides great support to its recipients, the application rates have been steadily declining. 

Driving up **awareness** whilst making the **application process** smoother will continue to help ensure that the support available is provided to those in need. This will become increasingly important, should the upper age for prescription exemption increase.
