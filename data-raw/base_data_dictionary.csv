FIELD,DESCRIPTION,QUESTIONS
CASEREF,"Unique identifier used to identify a single application/certificate
Used as the key field for linking many of the tables in LIS.",
REGISTERED,Date the application was registered on the system,
APPLICATION_MONTH,Derived from the REGISTERED date and in format of YYYYMM,
CLAIMTYPE,"Identifier for the type of claim submitted
0 = represents claims via HC1 (support)
1 = represents claims via HC1 with a HC5
3 = represents a HC5 claim (refund)",
CERTTYPE,"Outcome of application: 
AHC4 : HC4 – over capital limit
HBDTC : Tax credit exemption
HBD03 : Nass supported (asylum seeker)
HBD08 : Passporting benefit
AHC3 : HC3 partial help with health costs
AHC2 : HC2 – full help with health costs
AHC5 : HC5 - Refund. 

This is for HC1 element only. Outcomes regarding refunds are dealt with in data enclosures",
LASTASSESSMENTREC,Use this for the data assessment table so that you select the last assessment rec no for each case ref when looking at refunds. Join to data assessment/enclosures on case ref and assessment rec no,
CASE_OUTCOME,"Derived from the status events:
APPLICATION_ONGOING = certificate has not yet been printed and application received since 01-Jan-2021
APPLICATION_WITHDRAWN = application explicitly withdrawn by customer
APPLICATION_ABANDONED = certificate has not been printed and application received before 01-Jan-2021
CERTIFICATE_ISSUED = certificate/response has been printed and issued to customer

Please note, the response could be a LIS support certifcate HC2/HC3 or a letter informing them they will not get additional support.

CERTIFICATE_ISSUED is the only outcome that represents a certificate being issued to the applicant.  Although cases with other outcomes may have a certificate record, these have not been issued to the customer.  For example, for APPLICATION_ONGOING the certificates may be currently sitting in a print queue whereas for APPLICATION_ABANDONED we may have requested additional information before printing the certificate but the applicant did not provide a response.",

RECTYPE,"The type of certificate produced based on the following options:
HC2  = full help with health costs
HC3  = partial assistance with health costs (excluding prescriptions)

HC4  = Overcapital
HBD03 = NASS Supported Asylum Seeker
UNKNW = This status likely identifies a case that was assessed but was caught as needing further information during checking",

Employment Deprivation (22.5%)

Health Deprivation and Disability (13.5%)
Crime (9.3%)
Barriers to Housing and Services (9.3%)

Please note: these scores do not represent the level of income deprivation and therefore can not be used to compare how income deprived are in relation to each other.

For example, LSOA_1 may have 50% of people classified as income deprived but these may have higher income levels than LSOA_2 where only 10% of people are classified as income deprived.",
